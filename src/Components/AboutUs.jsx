                My name is Dr. Rameshwar Kumar orthopedic and joint replacement surgeon I have been practicing for over 18 years. I studied extensively and earned MBBS, MS, DNB, and Much (Ortho) degrees. I felt that there was still more I could do to help people suffering from knee pain.

              <p className="description">
                One day, while meditating, I had a revelation. I realized that I could use my knowledge and the power of faith to help people heal without resorting to surgery or medications. I began developing a series of Miracle MP rituals that I believed could help alleviate knee pain.

            <p>
              Over the years, I had performed more than <strong>20,000 orthopedic and joint replacement surgeries</strong>. But I knew that not everyone could afford such procedures. So, I decided to give back to my community by offering free orthopedic surgeries for poor people. I had done over <strong>150 such surgeries</strong>, and the patients were grateful for my help.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am passionate to help people and I did not stop there. I also trained more than <strong>7,000 health workers</strong> in first aid, and I conducted over <strong>300 health camps</strong> in villages. My dedication to patients had earned me a reputation as a compassionate and caring doctor.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite my busy schedule, I always made time for consultations. I had given consultations to more than <strong>7 lakh patients</strong>, and my social media reach is over <strong>10 million people</strong>. My efforts had not gone unnoticed, and I had received numerous awards for my contributions to the medical field.
            </p>
            <p>
              I had found my life's purpose. I had dedicated my career to helping people in need and had made a real difference in the lives of countless patients. I hope it is inspired others to follow in my footsteps and make a positive impact on the world.
